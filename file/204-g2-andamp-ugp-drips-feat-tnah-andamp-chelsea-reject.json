bag<br> Way I’m landing on my feet first<br> Grinding till my teeth hurt<br> Creature of my demons<br> Feed ’em habits let the beast work<br> Got up off my keister<br> First I had to see Earth<br> 'Fore my atoms disperse<br> Beyond past the ether<br> Class clown to my teachers<br> Peers smoked the reefer<br> It’s more or less the same<br> Still wonder what I’ll be worth<br> And in these words<br> It’s hard to say exactly what I prefer<br> The business or the leisure<br> What’s a life without the reaper<br> So I’ma grab my nuts<br> Cause I’m that guy<br> My nose flared up<br> With my chest up high<br> I used to give two fucks<br> Going out my mind<br> It’s about that time<br> I obey the signs<br> And get what’s mine<br> Why are you so terrified<br> Life just passing you by<br> Don’t gotta live in the fear<br> Still gotta do it scared<br> Yeah<br> Looking to pick the fight<br> You feel it’s do or die<br> Should rest your heart and your mind<br> Invite the ease<br> I’m asking please<br> To talk to me<br> Enough disease<br> I just need to smoke<br> I just need to smoke <br> Still I need to find a new approach<br> A better way to cope<br> I just wanna go <br> I just wanna grow <br> Life been moving way too fast <br> Wonder why they always calling me<br> This spliff is all for me<br> Thinking they know everything<br> They been moving like Socrates<br> The wisest man understands<br> He do not know anything<br> Everything is everything<br> Need the freedom let it ring<br> I been going through some things<br> Relying on the Mary Jane<br> Not enough to numb the pain<br> If I could I would<br> I promise I’d smoke every strain<br> Roll it up I levitate<br> You ain’t puffin on that strong<br> My nigga you a featherweight<br> We ain’t gon be here that long<br> So I can never hesitate<br> At times I’m feeling lost<br> But I know I got much more to gain<br> I feel like Beyoncé<br> Know that I will never be replaced<br> Lately I don’t really give a fuck<br> <br> Tell me what is what<br> I been tryna get my figgas up<br> Still calling the plug<br> I Don’t know why he ain’t been picking up<br> Lately I don’t really give a fuck<br> Tell me what is what<br>
