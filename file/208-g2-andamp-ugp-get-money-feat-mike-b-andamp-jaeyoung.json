Mike B. & JAEYOUNG) </b> <br> <br>  <b>[Romanization]</b> <br><br>Chilly ice, neck bright<br> Bad bitch, head right<br> Up down, up down <br> Yo bitch she having her best night <br> Used to cop G’s OZ’s & P’s by the Best Buy<br> Blueprints of the street dreams right off the desktop<br> Fully in my essence and I know it<br> I been making money just to blow it<br> Higher my vibrations<br> I been having vivid visions, I just push-to-start PANAMERA Porsche 911 forest green <br> Fully loaded with the options feel the force<br> Engine purrin’ like the pussy on my women <br> Switching lanes<br> Hit the pedal, let the roof drop<br> Took the business ran the streets got up to the rooftops<br> Vision crystal clear like chandeliers yeah yeah<br> Manifested everything I wanted I got it<br> Pressure cooking diamonds from the dirt<br> Jazzin’ through finessing like I’m Stockton<br> <br> I been showed that I been a problem<br> I been cold as my inner conscious<br> I been told you I’m in a dive feelin more alive than ever<br> My kinfolk we’ll get money or we’ll die together<br> I’m in pinstripes<br> Big money big as my insight<br> I binge life then I blend right into midnight<br> I switch lives quick as a dish at a fish fry<br> I piss rhymes then I shit whatever I did like<br> I’m big time<br> Big Rollie at the Roland Garros<br> Kick only when I know it’s there<br> In a big moment I show up like the only parent<br> I’ll be there like the Jackson 5 Mariah Carey<br> But spare me any details<br> I’m sick of listening<br> It’s missing it isn’t it<br> Like the wind you’re pissin in<br> Look this is it<br> This isn’t what you thought was it<br> Windows tinted but you caught buggin<br> I love it<br> Now get money<br> Swishers and some Black Milds<br> Poison in my styrofoam<br> Packed about half a pound<br> The neighbors know when I’m coming home<br> Posted in the building<br> Got some demons going door to door<br> Peeping through the keyhole<br> See ’em waiting in the corridor<br> I got greed growing more and more<br> Needs by the dollar signs<br> Keys to the foreign cars<br> Yeah I got that item 9<br> It’s the bee’s knees from the underground<br> Not a damn stain on me even when it’s summertime<br> Get money and we gon’ get money<br> Money over bitches cause the bitches love the..<br> Real estate up in the summit<br> Gotta stay up just to fund it<br> But for now yo let me run it<br> Till my numbers in abundance<br> More money more problems I can use some more of it<br> Quit the bitchin’ I don’t know that kinda subject<br> Been ballin on a budget since a youngin’ from the stoop<br> Texas piece up on my neck<br> With UGP still in the stu so we<br> Get money and we gon’ get money<br> Dem boys fresh but they not this dummy<br> Get money and we gon’ get money<br> Dopeman clean not a damn stain on me<br><br> <b>[Hangeul]</b> <br><br>Chilly ice, neck bright<br><br>Bad bitch, head right<br><br>Up down, up down <br><br>Yo bitch she having
