JAEYOUNG) </b> <br> <br>  <b>[Romanization]</b> <br><br>I got my eye sight on the gleam<br> Swerving on hoes for self esteem<br> More weight on the gold till my neck gon lean<br> What the fuck you mean<br> From the south side where' we outside<br> Like seven days a week<br> Same old kid from the stoop<br> Wit the swisher sweets<br> Marlboro reds wit a list of things<br> 40’s on the curb wit UGP<br> Everyday I sustain so I everything I obtain<br> I gotta double up to know that it’s a sure thing<br> I was trying to feast but the world only gave me a lunch tray<br> Had to switch up the feng shui<br> Why look back on a one way<br> Take my shots couple of pump fakes<br> Foot on the gas like fuck brakes<br> Aint’ no stopping unless we gunbae/geombae<br> Talks of dreams hope for that one day<br> Toxic demons that won’t go away<br> Wash it down, weed and some Bombay<br> I feel alive but in a numb state yeah<br> When I’m coming down that’s just a tough break<br> No crashing down, down in my own wave<br> Amphetamine I know exactly how the salt taste<br> Playing catch up with the time that’s an update yeah<br> Got my head up cause I know I ain’t up there yet<br> They say sky is the limit bitch I’ll say when<br> I feel holy with the spirits so I stay blessed<br> Bless the empty souls in searching for the serotonin<br> Walk the line until the morning sun is up and running<br> Flush the poison, mama tell me time and time again<br> Easy does it,<br> You got all the time inside your hands<br> I Got my eye sight on the gleam<br> Swerving on hoes for self esteem<br> More weight on the gold till my neck gon’ lean<br> What the fuck you mean<br> From the south side where' we outside<br> Like seven days a week<br> Same old kid from the stoop<br> Wit the swisher sweets<br> Marlboro reds wit a list of things<br> 40’s on the curb wit UGP<br> Convo from a movie scene<br> Soju bottles smoking green<br> Bullshit bout the same old shit<br> For the day 1s I done came up wit<br> Thinkin' bout some ways to get paid<br> Took some plays took the crooked way<br> Took my piece and took the cake look it<br> I been cooking foot is so far up they asses<br> So far up I’m lookin past em<br> So far gone there’s nothing back there don’t look back there<br> Came to do something ill<br> Fate will do what it wills<br> I came to do what I want<br> I came to ruin ya lunch<br> Yeah you can take the fast lane<br> But two can play at that game<br> I chew what I can swallow<br> Get thru the pain and sorrows<br> I make em make the yuck face<br> I made some major upgrades<br> I made it to make it, I take it in paces and I make it amazing<br> I make em make the yuck face<br> I made some major upgrades<br> I made it to make it, I take it in paces and I make it amazing<br> I
